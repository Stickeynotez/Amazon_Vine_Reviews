# Amazon_Vine_Reviews

## Overview
The Amazon Vine program is a tool to allow manufacturers to receive reviews on their products.
Companies will pay Amazon a fee, and give products to Vine members, who are then required to publish
a review on the product. This project compares the reviews of Vine members vs non members in the aspect of
total % and number of 5 star reviews

## Results
For my project, I chose reviews on software for my data.

The table provided is the analysis done to understand if the reviews on software is affected by 
a paid Vine user or not. 




- here are 0 reviews from vine members, this shows that software is less likely to be given away/
- there are only a total of 314 5 star reviews, no vine users cause this dataset to have a 0 correlation factor.
